# Basic or almost basic *TODO* task in `Angular 5 + TypeScript`.

I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be... Yeah, it's just one evening work, but I've spent nearly 5 hours to get it done.   
I'm not too pleased with my results, but in general that was entertaining activity and final outcome is not bad at all.   
You can grab it, `ng serve` and then just give it a try.
